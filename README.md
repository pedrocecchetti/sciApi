Yeah, I kno , it's pretty nice to see ho stubborn Charizard is and which abilities he has.  
Yeah, I agree that Slopoke is the best Pokemon ever and that Misty was always better than Ash and Brock.  
I am also indeed a fan of Pokemon, but wait, don't you think that the worlds most famous minds deserve their place in a
beautiful API?
